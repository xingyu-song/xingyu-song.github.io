# üåü About Me

I am currently a research assistant at the Graduate School of Engineering, University of Tokyo. My research focuses on computer vision, deep learning, and graph neural networks, particularly in the context of human motion understanding and representation. I am actively seeking PhD opportunities.

Feel free to contact me if you would like more information or access to the code related to my work.

[An Animation-based Augmentation Approach for Action Recognition from Discontinuous Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06741)

**Xingyu Song**, Zhan Li, Shi Chen, Xin-Qiang Cai, Kazuyuki Demachi, In: Proceedings of the 27th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI‚Äô24), Santiago de Compostela, Spain, Oct. 19-24, 2024 (Oral)

[**Project**](https://github.com/xingyu-song/4A) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- 4A (Action Animation-based Augmentation Approach) is a pipeline that enhances action recognition by generating animated pose data through 2D pose estimation, Quaternion-based GCN, and Dynamic Skeletal Interpolation, which effectively bridging the gap between virtual and real-world data and achieving superior performance with significantly less data.
